# ONTONERD Ontology Name Entity Recognition and Disambiguation

ONTONERD is as Entity Linking for ontologies. 
Entity linking for ontology terms aims to associate mention in text with a knowledge base of ontologies.

Current Natural Language Processing (NLP) models for entity linking need training in annotated datasets. Such datasets are limited and costly to assemble (need domain expertise). To address this challenge, we propose to create such datasets by leveraging the information of ontologies, which is already curated by domain expertise.
